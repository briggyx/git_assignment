> a. What is an _issue_?

In Git, an issue is a tool used to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or any other type of discussion related to the repository.

- **Bug Tracking**: Used to report and track bugs or problems in the software.
- **Feature Requests**: Allows users to suggest new features or enhancements.
- **Task Management**: Breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Documentation and Discussion**: Provides a space for discussion and feedback on specific topics.
- **Labels and Milestones**: Categorizes and prioritizes issues with labels and organizes them under milestones.
- **Assignment and Collaboration**: Assigns issues to specific contributors for resolution, facilitating collaboration.
- **Integration with Commits and Pull Requests**: Links issues with commits and pull requests for better traceability of changes.

> b. What is a _pull request_?

A pull request (often abbreviated as PR) is a feature that allows developers to notify team members that they have completed some work on a branch and would like it to be reviewed, discussed, and potentially merged into another branch, typically the main branch of the repository.

- **Code Review**: Allows team members to review and provide feedback on proposed changes.
- **Proposing Changes**: Used to propose changes from a feature branch to a main branch.
- **Branch Management**: Helps manage separate feature branches to avoid disrupting the main codebase.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automatically runs tests and checks to ensure new code doesnâ€™t break existing functionality.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates discussion and collaboration among team members on code changes.
- **Documentation**: Acts as a record of what changes were made, why, and how they were reviewed.
- **Automated Merging**: Once approved, allows for automated merging of changes into the main branch.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Provides a mechanism for outside contributors to suggest changes to a project.
